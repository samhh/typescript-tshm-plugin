## 0.1.0 (2021-07-28)

This is the plugin's initial release targeting tshm 0.4.x.

It currently only supports the simplest of circumstances, specifically most top-level declarations. Output is currently printed below the normal type signature in "quick info", which is on hover in something like VSCode.
